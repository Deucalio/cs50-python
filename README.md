# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python
This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for the CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python course.

### About the Course
CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python is a beginner-friendly online course designed to teach the fundamentals of programming in Python. The course explores topics such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming and each week, students complete problem sets that challenge their understanding of the material.

## Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that using code from this repository violates academic honesty. Not only will be depriving yourself of learning how to code but you will also learn nothing about programming in general, and that defeats the whole purpose of the course. If you come across something that is difficult to wrap your head around then look for other resources because you can find a myriad of ways on the internet to tackle the problem.
