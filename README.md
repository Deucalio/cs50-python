## Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that using code from this repository violates academic honesty. Not only will you be depriving yourself of learning how to code but you will also learn nothing about programming in general, and that defeats the whole purpose of the course. If you come across something that is difficult to wrap your head around then look for other resources because you can find a myriad of ways on the internet to tackle the problem.
